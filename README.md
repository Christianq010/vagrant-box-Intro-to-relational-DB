# Using a Virtual Machine w/ Relational Database
==============================================

## Description
A project set up to use a virtual machine (VM) to run an SQL database server and a web app that uses it.
The VM is a Linux server system that runs on top of your own computer.
* We can share files easily between our computer and the VM
* We'll be running a web service inside the VM which we'll be able to access from our regular browser locally.

We're using tools called Vagrant and VirtualBox to install and manage the VM. You'll need to install these to do some of the exercises.

## Prerequisites -
* We'll using a Unix-style terminal on your computer. On Windows, we recommend using the Git Bash terminal that comes with the Git software (www.git-scm.com).

## Instructions
* VirtualBox is the software that actually runs the virtual machine
 * Install VirtualBox - (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
* Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer and the VM's filesystem
 * Install Vagrant - (https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
 * To find out if vagrant has successfully installed type `vagrant --version` into git bash or cmd
